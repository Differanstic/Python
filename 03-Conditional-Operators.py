Conditional Operators in Python
Conditional operators, also known as comparison operators, are used to compare two values.
They return a boolean value (True [1] or False [1]) based on the comparison.

a = 5
b = 3

# Conditional Operator -> [0,1] [False, True]

c = a == b
print("A Equal to: B", c)

c = a != b
print("A Not equal to: B", c)

c = a > b
print("A Greater than: B", c)

c = a < b
print("A Less than: B", c)

a = b # Reassigning b to a for comparison

c = a >= b
print("A Greater than or equal to: B", c)

c = a <= b
print("A Less than or equal to: B", c)
